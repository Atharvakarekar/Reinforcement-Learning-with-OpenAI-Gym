# Reinforcement-Learning-with-OpenAI-Gym

Reinforcement learning (RL) is a branch of machine learning that deals with learning from actions and rewards. OpenAI Gym¹ is a toolkit for developing and comparing RL algorithms. It provides a standard interface for interacting with different environments, such as simulated robots, Atari games, and classic control problems². You can use OpenAI Gym to learn the basics of RL, experiment with different algorithms, and benchmark your results³.
